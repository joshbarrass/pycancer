# Background #

This game was originally created by Louie and me in
[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), during the height of the fidget
spinner's popularity. Originally known as Fidget Spinner Simulator, we
later changed the name to "cancer" (or, in contexts where a
politically correct name was required, "bungus") to reflect how bad it
was. As prefects overseeing computer rooms, we introduced our game to
the masses. It was surprisingly popular, sparking competition, and our
game was upgraded over the course of a year.

Since leaving school, I got thinking about our game again. It was
surprisingly _fun_. Whilst Scratch is still around, I thought it might
be nice to port our game to a "real" language. This project is
designed to be as close as I can get to the original project using
Pygame.
